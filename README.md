# Browser Notes - An notetaking single page app for taking notes without leaving the web browser.

# Capstone Prerequisites

The following link was used to kickstart this Django project using the Django CookieCutter template:https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
This will set up a Users model for you after you register. Along with Bootstrap CSS and Javascript which you may use if you wish. 
  
# Python
This project was made with Python 3.5 see this link for the lastest version if you need Python:
https://www.python.org/

# Pip and Virtualenv
Python 3.4 and higher already has pip but here is the standalone pip installer:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py

It is recommended to use the virtualenvwrapper here:
https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#

This should give you everything you need to get going. See the Django Documentation here:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/install/
for any further information on Django installation.

# Django Documentation
The Django documentation was also used extensively while building this project. Login and logut form templates for authentication are built in to Django and I recommend using modified versions of them. See official documentation home page here:
