## Running Notes
The program Running Notes has 2 models inside the Django SQL database. They are Users and Notes. The Notes model contains fields named user, created, modified and note respectively. 
The notes template uses these fields and iterates over them for each new note with the attributes named note.user, note.created, note.modified and note.note respectively.
